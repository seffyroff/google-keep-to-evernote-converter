At the above URL, you can also find the motto and instructions for this script.

But, basically:
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
2. Download your Google Keep notes with Google Takeout
3. Extract the .HTMLs to a dir
4. Run this script providing "<dir>/*.html" as an argument

:+1: Tested ok under Windows, Mac and Linux

I've never tested this with more than 200 notes, but anyway this has worked for me.

I made this public 'cause I feel it might be useful for more people, but this is far from a beautiful code. I *might* modify it in case it can't help anyone in its current state.
